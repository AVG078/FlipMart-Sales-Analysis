# FlipMart Sales Analysis

Profit Prediction Model (Tkinter + Machine Learning).
This Python project is a Profit Prediction Model using Polynomial Regression and a Tkinter-based GUI.




## Features
1.Data Processing: Reads and preprocesses sales data from an Excel file.

2.Polynomial Regression: Trains a 4-degree polynomial regression model to predict profit based on sales data.
Performance Evaluation: Calculates model accuracy using the R¬≤ score.

3.User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to input sales values and get profit predictions.

4.Visualization: Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for data analysis (not displayed in UI).

5.Data Visualization:
Tableau & Power BI Dashboards used to analyze and visualize data with various parameter
## Dependencies

## Models used for analysis
1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous variable based on input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and independent variable(s) (X). The equation is:

### Y=mX+b
   Y = Predicted output   
   ùëö = Slope (coefficient)  
   X = Input feature  
   b = Intercept

2. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is an extension of Linear Regression, where the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is modeled as an n-degree polynomial equation:
 ### Y=Œ≤0+Œ≤1X+Œµ
It is useful when the data shows a non-linear trend but is still continuous.

3. Decision Tree Regression
A Decision Tree is a non-linear regression model that splits the data into smaller regions based on conditions. It creates a tree structure where:

Each node represents a decision on a feature.
Each branch represents an outcome.
The leaf nodes contain the predicted values.
## Tools used for visualization and creating DashBoards

1. Tableau
Tableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence (BI) tool used to analyze and present data interactively. It enables users to create dashboards, reports, and charts without needing advanced coding skills.

2. Power BI
Power BI, developed by Microsoft, is another BI and data visualization tool that helps businesses transform raw data into meaningful insights through interactive reports and dashboards.
